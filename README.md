# SolarSystem

Simple WPF windows app that demonstrates the orbits of the planets around the Sun.  

Code is forked from Ivan Krivvakov's original WPF project here:

Notes:
* Planet and Sun sizes are not to scale
* Planet distances are scaled to each other with Earth being 1 AU.  However the distance from Earth to the Sun is not scaled correctly.
